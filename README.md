# Top 15 Web-Based CVEs (September–November 2025)

This report contains a research-based security analyzing the **top 15 high-risk web and enterprise CVEs identified between September and November 2025**. The report examines critical vulnerabilities affecting widely used platforms such as **Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, Fortinet, SAP, Adobe, and Azure**, covering attack types including **remote code execution (RCE), privilege escalation, authentication bypass, deserialization flaws, memory corruption, and container escape**.

The analysis highlights **CVSS severity, exploitation status (active and high-risk), real-world attack impact, and affected infrastructure**, supported by comparative tables and a vulnerability-type distribution graph. Not all vulnerabilities included were actively exploited, but all represent significant risk based on severity and exposure.

This work is intended to provide **security teams, researchers, and defenders** with a concise and practical understanding of emerging vulnerability trends and enterprise risk during **September–November 2025**.
